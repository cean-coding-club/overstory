# Overstory

An app for displaying the trees on campus.  The intended use is for staff and students to navigate around campus and learn about our trees.

The rough development direction is to use RShiny as a platform.

A rough outline for the Overstory app's user interface can be found [here.](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGozk8vFQ0/lslg0dFuBsnyJOR7C5wYuw/edit?utm_content=DAGozk8vFQ0&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton) 

This is a work in progress.  Possible directions include:

* Links to information about the tree species (from, for example, wikipedia)
* Generate a walk across campus to meet a tree
* User contributions of their stories about campus trees

But for now, we are mostly just playing :-)
